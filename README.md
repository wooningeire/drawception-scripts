# Drawception scripts

Various scripts created to be ran on Drawception pages, including utilities and scumming. Likely will not work anymore due to UI updates and changes to how certain parts of the site work.

* `drawception.js`: Allows easy access to composite operations in the drawing canvas. (2017-08-12)
* `drcaptionfisher.js`: Repeatedly skips prompts until coming across a specific caption that you may have skipped on accident. (2018-06-20)
* `drpointscounter.js`: Gathers the point counts of each of someone’s panels, and then calculates some statistics as well as generates a graph illustrating the distribution of scores. (2018-07-04)
* `drpanelliker(?:.*).js`: Goes through each one of someone's participated games and likes everyone’s panels in each game, back when Drawception had a points system. I don’t recall why there are 4 different versions saved (maybe destructive patches), but by last-edited dates are in descending order, they are:
    * `drpanellikerd.js` (2018-07-06)
    * `drpanelliker.js` (2018-07-06)
    * `drpanellikerff.js` (2018-07-07)
    * `drpanellikerf.js` (2018-07-07)
